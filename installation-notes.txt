I forked this repo to fix an annoy bug. The original program won't work on old Python, but work with old ffmpeg :)
So, this is important note, please read it before install or use ShortGPT:

- OS: Debian 11 x64

- Install Python version: 3.11.3
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 
sudo apt install wget build-essential libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/Python-3.11.3.tgz 
tar xzf Python-3.11.3.tgz 
cd Python-3.11.3 
./configure --enable-optimizations
make install

To check the Python version, use this command: python3.11 -V 
To use pip, use this command: pip3.11 install <package-name>

- Install ffmpeg version: 4.2.3
Certainly! Building and installing a custom version of FFmpeg on Debian 11 involves a series of steps. Here's a guide to help you through the process:

### 1. Install Build Dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential git
sudo apt build-dep ffmpeg
```

### 2. Clone FFmpeg Source Code:

```bash
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
git checkout n4.2.3
```

### 3. Configure FFmpeg Build:

```bash
./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
```

This step checks for the necessary dependencies and configures the build based on your system.

### 4. Build FFmpeg:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

This step may take some time as it compiles the FFmpeg source code.

### 5. Install FFmpeg:

```bash
sudo make install
```

### 6. Verify Installation:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

This should display the version information, and you should see the version 4.2.3.

### Optional: Update Library Cache:

```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

This updates the dynamic linker run-time bindings.

That's it! You should now have FFmpeg version 4.2.3 installed on your Debian 11 system.

If you arre still facing with "libavdevice.so.58" error when run ffmpeg, run this command to fix it, remember to change the path:
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64/:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

- Install needed package for pillow:
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev

Now you're ready to clone my forked repo and run ShortGPT ;)
